## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted teal (#70A4A7) for a professional and calming feel.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to create a soft, neutral backdrop, helping other elements to stand out and minimizing distraction.
- Accent color: Soft coral (#F08080) to draw the eye to key interactive elements. Provides a gentle contrast to the muted teal, signalling importance while avoiding harshness.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that maintains a clean, machined appearance. This will ensure legibility and lend an objective touch.
- Use a consistent style for icons that aligns with the overall minimalist aesthetic. Simple, line-based icons are preferable.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with plenty of white space to allow the content to breathe.
- Subtle transition effects can be used when navigating between sections.
